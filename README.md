The AMC Commander is upset that the average time taken by a US Platoon to arrive at the destination is on average 107 hours. Our task is to decrease the average time by using OR techniques.

## Waiting Time before Additional Fleet Deployment 
The average time taken by a platoon based on the following routes is 107.086 hours (roughly 4.46 days) with a range of [106.1975, 107.9746] for a 95% confidence interval. 
Let us look at the plot statistics before deploying additional planes.

## Our Next Step
We have the option of adding one 777 and or one C-5 to reduce the travel time. Looking at the utilization graph, we can see that the 777 on the Baltimore-Ramstein leg is just over 80 % utilization and the C-5 on the Lakenheath-Doha leg is nearly 100 % utilized. After evaluating all possible combinations, we determined the optimal thing to do is add one C-5 to the Lakenheath-Doha leg.

The average time for platoon decreased from  107.086 hours to 98.8821 hours. 
We noticed a drop in the utilization of C-5 in the Lakenheath - Doha. 
Here are the Plot Statistics
